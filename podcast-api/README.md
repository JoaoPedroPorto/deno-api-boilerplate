# PODCAST-API

This is a totally fake REST API using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server), which provides a fast backend for prototyping and simulation.

## Usage

```sh
    # install node version and dependencies
    nvm install && npm ci (npm i)

    # start
    npm run server
```

### Requires
- Node.js and npm
- nvm

### Note

For ".editorconfig" to work, we need to install the "EditorConfig" extension on VS Code.
